1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.


Probably no if it need "full" features I think, because sending message might involve interacting with other components within the application. However, it can be used to test partially like message validation and handling user input correctly.

2. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.


Yes! We can use unit testing for this because it's a specific functionality within a single unit, and do not require interation with other components.
